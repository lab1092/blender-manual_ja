#~ "This effect makes parts of an image glow brighter by working on the "

#~ "properties, you control this :guilabel:`Threshold:`, the maximum luminosity "
#~ "that can be added (:guilabel:`Clamp:`), a :guilabel:`Boost factor:` for it, "
#~ "the size of the blur (:guilabel:`Blur distance:`), and its "
#~ ":guilabel:`Quality:`. The :guilabel:`Only boost` button allows you to only "
