"You may ask yourself \"but the surface appears to be 3D, why is it only "
"2D?\". In order to be 3D, the object needs to have \"Volume,\" and a "
"surface, even when it is closed, doesn't have volume; it is infinitely thin."
" If it had a volume the surface would have a thickness (its third "
"dimension). Hence, it's only a 2D object, and has only two interpolation "
"dimensions or axes or coordinates (if you know a bit of math, think of non-"
"euclidean geometry - well, surfaces are just non-euclidean 2D planes...). To"
" take a more \"real life\" example, you can roll a sheet of paper to create "
"a cylinder; well, even if it \"draws\" a volume, the sheet itself will "
"remain a (nearly...) 2D object!"

"So you have \"U-rows\" and \"V-rows\" in a NURBS surface. The key point is "
