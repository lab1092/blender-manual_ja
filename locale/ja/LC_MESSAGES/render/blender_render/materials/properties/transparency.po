"Materials in Blender can be set to be transparent, so that light can pass "
"through any objects using the material. Transparency is controlled using an "
"\"alpha\" channel, where each pixel has an additional value, range 0-1, in "
"addition to its RGB color values. If alpha=0, then the pixel is transparent,"
" and the RGB values for the surface contribute nothing to the pixel's "
"appearance; for alpha=1, the surface is fully opaque, and the color of the "
