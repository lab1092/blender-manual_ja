msgid ""
"Let's take the best real world equivalent: a compass. It can rotate to point"
" in the general direction of its target (the magnetic North, or a neighbor "
"magnet), but it can't point *directly at it*, because it spins like a wheel "
"on an axle. If a compass is sitting on a table and there is a magnet "
"directly above it, the compass can't point to it. If we move the magnet more"
" to one side of the compass, it still can't point *at* the target, but it "
"can point in the general direction of the target, and still obey its "
"restrictions of the axle."

"The *Locked Track* constraint is a bit tricky to explain, both graphically "

" cannot rotate (change its orientation). Hence, the owner can only track its"
